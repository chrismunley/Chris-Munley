        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Christain, but you can call me Chris. A little about me:<br><br>I grew up and have lived in Middletown, Delaware all my life. Soon, I will be making a big leap and entering college! Some of the schools I plan on applying to include Carnegie Mellon, California Institute of Technology, Georgia Tech, University of Michigan, and University of South Carolina.<br><br>Ever since I was young, I always played sports. I played soccer and baseball from when I could walk, and later in middle school I got into lacrosse. Now, at the end my of high school career, I mainly play tennis and do water sports such as wakeboarding and skimboarding.<br><br>I started a non profit organizaiton to help residents of nursing homes around my community, which came to be known as Wisdom for the Ages Foundation. What we basically do is bring books, magazines, and other requested things to nursing homes and other assisted living centers so that the residents can enjoy them. My inspiration for this project came from my grandmother. For years now, she has been hopping from one nursing home to the next, trying to find something that suits her. As many grandmothers are, mine is an avid reader. She averages a book a day. As you can imagine, she goes through a lot of books. Almost every week she would ask me or my parents to bring her more books to read. Thus, I thought, why don't all nursing homes have a suppply of books and entertainment materials for all of their residents. I could find no real reason, so I took the matters into my own hands and started bringing books to local nursing homes every month. Check out our website at <a href="#">wisdomfortheages.com</a>!<br><br>Another one of my passions is learning. I always try my best to meet and exceed any teacher's expectations. By the end of high school for me, I should have around 11 or 12 AP classes. Also, I was 60 points off a perfect score on the new SAT. Over the summer of 2017, I held two internships. One internship was with Dr. Jack Puleo at the Coastal Engineering and Research center at the University of Delaware. With Dr. Puleo, I worked on an arduino based solar powered camera that can send pictures wirelessly over Xbee radio modules. The other internship I help was with Dr. Sunita Chandrakesaran in the Computational Programming and Research Lab at the University of Delaware. Here I delved into more advanced topics of computer science such as parallel programming. Specifically, I learned how to use OpenACC, OpenMP, and MPI to speed up real life applications. Also, I may dive into machine learning in the near future.<br><br></p>
